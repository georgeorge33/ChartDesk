# Data in Chartdesk

Chartdesk draws on several public datasets. Most are public domain; one is not, and that one
comes with obligations rather than courtesies.

## OpenStreetMap — ODbL 1.0

**What:** `Resources/land-osm.txt`, the simplified coastline, built by
`Tools/make_coastline.py` from
[osmdata.openstreetmap.de](https://osmdata.openstreetmap.de/data/land-polygons.html). The
optional full coastline, built by the same script into Application Support, is from the same
source.

**Licence:** [Open Database License 1.0](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1-0/).

**What that requires of this app, and where it is done:**

- **Attribution.** "© OpenStreetMap contributors" has to be shown wherever the data is drawn.
  The map's readout carries it whenever an OpenStreetMap coastline is selected, and the Layers
  panel carries it beside the choice.
- **Share-alike.** Those tables are a Derived Database, so they are offered under ODbL too —
  not under whatever terms the rest of this app carries. Take them and the same conditions
  follow you.

Chartdesk ships Natural Earth as the default coastline, and never needs OpenStreetMap to work.
The choice is in Layers, on the map.

## Natural Earth — public domain

`Resources/land-*.txt`, `lakes-*.txt`, `borders-*.txt`, at 1:110m, 1:50m and 1:10m, built by
`Tools/make_mapdata.py`. [naturalearthdata.com](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/about/terms-of-use/)
places these in the public domain, with no attribution required. It is credited anyway, in the
headers of the tables and in the release notes.

## OurAirports — public domain

`Resources/airports.txt`, `runways.txt` and `runway-ends.txt`, from
[ourairports.com](https://ourairports.com/data/) by way of
[davidmegginson/ourairports-data](https://github.com/davidmegginson/ourairports-data). Public
domain. Comes with no guarantee of accuracy, which is why your own charts outrank it wherever
the two disagree.

## FAA CIFP — public domain

The SID and STAR altitude restrictions, from the FAA's Coded Instrument Flight Procedures,
reissued every 28 days and fetched by the app itself. A work of the United States government
and so not subject to copyright. United States only.

None of this is for real-world navigation. Chartdesk is for flight simulation.
